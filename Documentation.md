## Campaign Management

### Creating a Campaign

1. **Basic Information**
   - Campaign name and description
   - Select routing type (Direct, Pool, RTB)
   - Set campaign status

2. **Phone Number Assignment**
   - **Direct**: Assign a specific phone number
   - **Pool**: Select from available number pools
   - **RTB**: Configure auction parameters

3. **Buyer Configuration**
   - Add buyers with contact information
   - Set routing priorities (1-10)
   - Configure capacity limits
   - Set schedule restrictions

4. **Advanced Settings**
   - Enable/disable call recording
   - Set timeout values
   - Configure webhook URLs
   - Enable tracking pixels

### Campaign Status Management

- **Active**: Campaign accepts and routes calls
- **Paused**: Campaign temporarily stopped
- **Completed**: Campaign finished and archived
- **Draft**: Campaign being configured

### Campaign Validation

The system automatically validates:
- At least one active buyer is assigned
- Phone numbers are properly configured
- Webhook URLs are accessible
- Capacity limits are reasonable

---

## Call Routing System

### Routing Algorithms

**1. Priority-Based Routing**
- Routes calls to highest priority available buyer
- Considers capacity limits and availability
- Fallback to lower priority buyers when needed

**2. Round-Robin Routing**
- Distributes calls evenly among available buyers
- Tracks last assignment for fair distribution
- Respects capacity limits and schedules

**3. Pool-Based Routing**
- Assigns tracking numbers dynamically from pools
- Prevents number conflicts between campaigns
- Supports campaign-specific number assignment

### Routing Decision Factors

- **Buyer Priority**: Higher priority buyers receive calls first
- **Availability**: Only route to available buyers
- **Capacity Limits**: Respect concurrent call limits
- **Schedule**: Honor time-based restrictions
- **Geographic**: Route based on caller location (optional)

### Routing Metrics

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successfully routed calls
- **Average Response Time**: Time to connect calls
- **Buyer Utilization**: Capacity usage per buyer
- **Fallback Rate**: Calls routed to secondary buyers

---

## Number Pool Management

### Pool Concepts

**Number Pools** are collections of phone numbers that can be dynamically assigned to campaigns for tracking purposes. Each pool ensures exclusive number assignment to prevent conflicts.

### Pool Features

- **Exclusive Assignment**: Numbers can only belong to one pool
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Numbers assigned on-demand
- **Conflict Prevention**: System prevents duplicate assignments
- **Webhook Management**: Automatic webhook configuration

### Pool Management

**Creating Pools:**
1. Define pool name (unique per user)
2. Add phone numbers to the pool
3. Configure webhook settings
4. Set pool status (active/inactive)

**Number Assignment:**
- Numbers automatically assigned from available pool
- Exclusive assignment prevents conflicts
- Webhook URLs updated automatically
- Assignment tracking for analytics

**Pool Analytics:**
- Number utilization rates
- Assignment history
- Performance metrics per number
- Pool efficiency reporting

- Track visitor sessions and attribution

**2. JavaScript SDK**
- Lightweight client-side tracking
- Automatic phone number replacement
- Session management and persistence

**3. Attribution Tracking**
- UTM parameter capture
- Referrer tracking
- Session-based attribution

### DNI Implementation

**Step 1: Create Tracking Tag**
```javascript
// Generated tracking code
<script>
(function() {
  const tagCode = 'campaign_landing_page';
  const apiUrl = 'https://your-domain.com/api/dni/track';
  
  // Track visitor and get phone number
  fetch(apiUrl, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      tagCode: tagCode,
      sessionId: generateSessionId(),
      referrer: document.referrer,
      userAgent: navigator.userAgent,
      // UTM parameters automatically captured
    })
  })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    if (data.success) {
      // Replace phone numbers on page
      document.querySelectorAll('.phone-number').forEach(el => {
        el.textContent = data.formattedNumber;
      });
    }
  });
})();
</script>
```

**Step 2: HTML Integration**
```html
<!-- Phone number placeholder -->
<span class="phone-number">+1-800-DEFAULT</span>

<!-- Or direct integration -->
<div id="dynamic-phone">Loading...</div>
```

**Step 3: Attribution Tracking**
- Automatic UTM parameter capture
- Session persistence across page views
- Call attribution to original source

3. **Plan for Failures**: Include timeout handling and error recovery
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track execution metrics and user behavior
5. **Document Flows**: Use clear connection labels and node descriptions

**Node Configuration Tips:**
- **IVR Menus**: Keep options clear and limited (max 5-6 options)
- **Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for user response (10-15 seconds)
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and retry logic
- **Voice Quality**: Test TTS messages for clarity and pronunciation
- **Business Hours**: Account for timezone differences and holidays

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Connection Efficiency**: Minimize complex nested flows
- **Session Management**: Keep session data lightweight
- **Tracking Balance**: Track essential metrics without overwhelming system
- **Failover Planning**: Include backup routes for critical flows

### Integration with Campaign System

**Campaign Assignment:**
1. Navigate to campaign details page
2. Access "Call Flow" tab in campaign configuration
3. Select active flow from dropdown menu
4. Save campaign to activate flow-based routing

**Flow Priority System:**
- **High Priority**: Call flows take precedence over traditional routing
- **Fallback Routing**: If no flow assigned, use traditional buyer routing
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine flow-based and traditional routing seamlessly

**Real-time Execution:**
- **Webhook Integration**: Flows execute automatically on incoming calls
- **Session Continuity**: Maintains state across IVR interactions
- **Analytics Tracking**: Real-time performance monitoring
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic fallback to traditional routing on failures

### Analytics and Reporting

The system generates production-ready TwiML for various scenarios:

```xml
<!-- IVR Menu Example -->
<Response>
  <Gather input="dtmf" timeout="10" numDigits="1">
    <Say>Press 1 for Sales, 2 for Support, or 3 for Billing</Say>
  </Gather>
  <Redirect>/api/flow/timeout</Redirect>
</Response>

<!-- Business Hours Example -->
<Response>
  <Say>We are currently closed. Please call back during business hours.</Say>
  <Hangup/>
</Response>

<!-- Traffic Splitting Example -->
<Response>
  <Dial timeout="30">
    <Number>+1800555PREMIUM</Number>
  </Dial>
</Response>
```

### Analytics and Tracking

The system provides comprehensive analytics for call flow performance:

- **Node Performance**: Execution times and success rates
- **Split Analytics**: Distribution effectiveness and performance
- **Pixel Tracking**: Conversion events and attribution
- **Session Analytics**: Flow completion rates and drop-off points
- **Business Hours Analytics**: Call volume patterns and peak times

### Integration with Campaign System

Call flows integrate seamlessly with the campaign management system:

- **Campaign Assignment**: Flows can be assigned to specific campaigns
- **Automatic Execution**: Flows execute when campaigns have active flows
- **Fallback Routing**: Traditional buyer routing when no flow is active
- **Performance Tracking**: Flow metrics integrated with campaign analytics
