Based on competitive analysis, your campaign system needs these 4 critical improvements to match industry leader Ringba:
❌ CURRENT PROBLEMS

Fragmented Setup - Users confused about next steps after creating campaign
No Validation - Can activate broken campaigns without buyers/phone numbers
Missing Pool Management - Can't change pool assignment after creation
No Setup Guidance - Users don't know if campaign is ready to go live

✅ REQUIRED CHANGES
CHANGE 1: Add Campaign Setup Wizard
Create new file: client/src/components/campaign/CampaignWizard.tsx
Goal: Guide users through complete campaign setup like Ringba does
Steps: Basic Info → Phone Strategy → Add Buyers → Configure Routing → Activate
CHANGE 2: Add Campaign Readiness Dashboard
Edit file: client/src/pages/campaign-detail.tsx
Goal: Show setup progress and validation like Ringba's campaign status
Features: Progress indicators, validation messages, activation blockers
CHANGE 3: Fix Pool Management in Settings
Edit file: client/src/components/campaign/CampaignSettings.tsx
Goal: Allow pool changes after creation (missing feature vs Ringba)
Action: Add pool dropdown to settings form
CHANGE 4: Add Smart Campaign Validation
Create new file: client/src/hooks/useCampaignValidation.ts
Goal: Prevent activating incomplete campaigns like Ringba does
Logic: Validate phone+buyers+routing before allowing "active" status
