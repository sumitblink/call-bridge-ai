Implement Complete Number Pool Flow - Missing UI Components
I need to implement the proper user flow for my call tracking platform. The backend routes already exist, but I'm missing the frontend UI components.
REQUIRED USER FLOW:
1. Create Campaign → 2. Add Buyers → 3. Add Publishers → 4. Create Number Pool → 5. Add Numbers to Pool → 6. Assign Pool to Campaign → 7. Activate Campaign
WHAT'S MISSING - PLEASE IMPLEMENT:
1. Number Pool Management UI

Create a new page: client/src/pages/number-pools.tsx
Add CRUD interface for number pools (create, edit, delete)
Include fields: name, pool size, assignment strategy, status
Show pool statistics (total numbers, available, assigned)

2. Pool Assignment Interface in Campaign Settings

Add "Number Pools" tab to campaign details page
Allow selecting and assigning pools to campaigns
Show pool priority and assignment status
Include pool statistics within campaign view

3. Add Numbers to Pool Interface

In the number pools page, add "Manage Numbers" button
Allow selecting purchased phone numbers to add to pool
Set number priority within pool
Show which numbers are in which pools

4. Pool Selection in Campaign Creation

Add pool selection dropdown in campaign creation form
Allow assigning pool during campaign setup
Show pool availability and capacity

5. Visual Flow Dashboard

Create a visual representation: Pool → Campaign → Buyers
Show routing flow with arrows and status indicators
Display pool utilization and campaign assignment status

EXISTING BACKEND ROUTES TO USE:

POST /api/number-pools - Create pool
PUT /api/number-pools/:id - Update pool
DELETE /api/number-pools/:id - Delete pool
POST /api/number-pools/:poolId/assign-number - Add number to pool
POST /api/campaigns/:campaignId/assign-pool - Assign pool to campaign
GET /api/campaigns/:id/pool-stats - Get pool statistics

REMOVE CONFLICTING FEATURES:

Remove direct phone number assignment from campaigns
Remove campaign dropdown from phone numbers page
Focus only on the pool-based assignment system

COMPONENTS TO CREATE:

client/src/components/NumberPoolManager.tsx
client/src/components/campaign/CampaignPools.tsx
client/src/components/PoolAssignmentDialog.tsx
client/src/components/NumberPoolStats.tsx
client/src/pages/number-pools.tsx

INTEGRATION POINTS:

Add "Number Pools" to main navigation
Add pool assignment tab to campaign details
Update campaign creation wizard to include pool selection
Show pool status in campaign list view

The backend APIs are already implemented and working. I just need the frontend components to complete the user flow. Please implement these UI components to match the existing design system using shadcn/ui components.
Focus on creating a clean, intuitive workflow that guides users through the 7-step process above.
