# Call Flow Creation Transcript

Before you can create a call Flow you need to have a routing plan configured on the sidebar navigate to call flows click on routing plans and select create routing plan if your routing plan a name then for routing type select which method of routing you prefer priority routing routes to targets based on the priority and weight while RPC routes to targets based on a target's revenue and historical performance after you select your routing type press create now you can choose to add specific targets groups and trees to your routing plan if you have chosen priority add a Target group or tree and assign a priority and wait then select how it will be counted as a conversion into a revenue amount for this Target and select how you would like ringba to handle duplicate conversions then press add to customize your call Flow ringba has developed a node-based system to give you more control and a visual representation of how your calls move to your system the call flows canvas is where you can perfectly craft your caller experience and build powerful call Flows In minutes to begin working with the call flows canvas click and drag on an empty part of the canvas to move around to any area of your call Flow you can also make the canvas as big or as small as you want using the minimize and maximize buttons in the bottom right corner or you can change the size of the canvas by holding Ctrl and scrolling up or down when creating a call Flow you will start with an inbound call node the inbound call node is the starting point for every call Flow you will need this node before you add any other connections there are a few ways to add a new node to your call Flow you can select the node options in the header by just clicking on it once or if you right click inside the canvas a list of available nodes will appear now that you have added a node you will need a way to connect nodes there are two ways to connect nodes you can connect nodes by clicking on the first node output then dragging and dropping the connection on the second node input or if you hover over the mouse and then select the Plus on the Node output you will be able to select the next node to remove a connection you can click on the X above the connection to remove that connector without deleting the node there are many different kinds of nodes to help you develop and manage your call Flow the dial node is used to Route calls to a Target the hang up node will terminate or end the call the menu node is used when you want to make a decision based on the key pressed the router node gives you the ability to make decisions based on filters The Gather node gives the ability to get a numerical input from the caller the go to node is used when you want to go back to a certain node that is already added to the flow the hours node is used when you want to validate and make call routing decisions based on hours of operation pixelnode gives you the ability to send and fire pixels based on the call Flow the play node will play a message to the caller when added to the call Flow the voicemail node can be used to provide the caller with a way to leave a message the JS node allows for custom JavaScript to execute it requires activation from the team the profile node is used to pull data enriched information about your caller with ringbus instant caller profile for this video let's look at how to make a call Flow using one of ringba's pre-built templates to create a call flow with a template go to manage call flows create using template the robocall verification template contains a simple menu that asks the caller to press a key in order to continue robocaller is unable to complete this verification will have the call automatically terminated in the menu node you'll see a pre-populated text to speech message that asks the caller to press 1 to continue this will help the filter spam robocallers from being routed to your targets to finish configuring this call Flow all we need to do is go to our dial node and add a routing plan now that you have set your nodes for your call Flow give your call Flow a name you can either save it as a draft for further editing or you can publish to begin utilizing your call Flow immediately
