# Pool Name Uniqueness Implementation

## Overview
Implemented unique pool name constraints to prevent creating multiple pools with identical names, ensuring clear pool identification and management.

## Changes Made

### Database Level
1. **Unique Constraint Added**: `unique_pool_name_per_user` on `number_pools(user_id, name)`
2. **Per-User Scope**: Pool names must be unique within each user's account
3. **Case-Sensitive Validation**: Pool names are enforced exactly as entered

### Backend Logic
1. **Enhanced Creation Method**: Updated `createNumberPool()` to handle duplicate name errors
2. **Descriptive Error Messages**: Shows which pool name already exists
3. **409 Conflict Response**: Proper HTTP status code for duplicate names
4. **Graceful Error Handling**: Clear distinction between validation and system errors

### Frontend Improvements
1. **Error Message Display**: Shows specific pool name conflict information
2. **Form Validation**: Prevents submission with duplicate names
3. **User Feedback**: Clear toast notifications for naming conflicts
4. **Improved UX**: Users understand exactly what needs to be changed

## Benefits

### Pool Management Clarity
- No confusion between pools with identical names
- Clear identification in pool selection interfaces
- Simplified pool administration and reporting

### Business Operations
- Accurate pool assignment in campaigns
- Clear analytics and performance tracking
- Reduced operational errors from naming confusion

### User Experience
- Immediate feedback on naming conflicts
- Clear guidance for resolving duplicate names
- Intuitive pool creation workflow

## Implementation Details

### Database Constraint
```sql
-- Prevents duplicate pool names per user
ALTER TABLE number_pools 
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_pool_name_per_user UNIQUE (user_id, name);
```

### Error Handling
- Database constraint violation triggers descriptive error message
- 409 Conflict HTTP status for duplicate name attempts
- Frontend displays specific pool name that conflicts

### Validation Flow
1. User submits pool creation form
2. Backend checks for existing pool with same name
3. Database constraint prevents duplicate insertion
4. Error message shows conflicting pool name
5. User modifies name and resubmits successfully

## Combined Pool Constraints
This implementation works alongside the existing phone number exclusivity:

1. **Pool Names**: Must be unique per user (prevents management confusion)
2. **Phone Numbers**: Must be exclusive to one pool (prevents routing conflicts)

Together, these constraints ensure clean pool management with no ambiguity in naming or number assignment.
