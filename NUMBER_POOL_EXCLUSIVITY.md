# Number Pool Exclusivity Implementation

## Overview
Implemented exclusive number assignment to ensure each phone number can only belong to one pool at a time, preventing routing conflicts and ensuring clear call attribution.

## Changes Made

### Database Level
1. **Unique Constraint Added**: `unique_phone_number_per_pool` on `number_pool_assignments.phone_number_id`
2. **Duplicate Pool Assignment Prevention**: `unique_campaign_pool` on `campaign_pool_assignments(campaign_id, pool_id)`
3. **Data Cleanup**: Removed existing duplicate pool assignments

### Backend Logic
1. **Enhanced Assignment Method**: Updated `assignNumberToPool()` to check for existing assignments
2. **Helpful Error Messages**: Provides specific pool names when conflicts occur
3. **Graceful Duplicate Handling**: Returns existing assignment if number already in same pool
4. **API Error Handling**: Returns 409 status code with descriptive error messages

### Frontend Improvements
1. **Better Error Handling**: Shows specific error messages about pool conflicts
2. **Batch Assignment Logic**: Handles partial success scenarios gracefully
3. **User Feedback**: Clear toast notifications for assignment conflicts

## Benefits

### Call Routing Clarity
- No ambiguity about which pool handles incoming calls
- Clear campaign attribution for analytics
- Simplified DNI logic with guaranteed unique assignments

### Data Integrity
- Prevents double-counting numbers in pool statistics
- Ensures accurate pool utilization metrics
- Eliminates routing conflicts between campaigns

### User Experience
- Clear error messages when attempting duplicate assignments
- Intuitive workflow for managing number assignments
- Transparent pool management with conflict resolution

## Usage

### Assigning Numbers
1. Numbers can only be in one pool at a time
2. System provides clear error if number already assigned elsewhere
3. User must remove from current pool before reassigning

### Pool Management
1. Pool statistics now accurately reflect exclusive assignments
2. Campaign pool assignments prevent duplicates automatically
3. DNI service uses clear pool-to-number relationships

## Technical Implementation

### Database Constraints
```sql
-- Prevents same number in multiple pools
ALTER TABLE number_pool_assignments 
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_phone_number_per_pool UNIQUE (phone_number_id);

-- Prevents duplicate campaign-pool assignments
ALTER TABLE campaign_pool_assignments 
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_campaign_pool UNIQUE (campaign_id, pool_id);
```

### Error Handling
- 409 Conflict status for duplicate assignments
- Descriptive error messages with pool names
- Graceful handling of partial batch operations

This implementation ensures clean number pool management with no routing ambiguity.
